# Lead Generation Tool for Photovoltaic Installation Companies

## Project Overview
This project aims to serve as a practical tool for lead generation—the process of identifying and generating potential client contacts.

The primary beneficiaries of this tool are service agencies that operate within a specific market niche: companies specializing in the installation of photovoltaic panels.

Context and Problem Statement
The project is set within the following fictional scenario:

The marketing agency "MediaBuy Srl" provides advertising sponsorship services to a precise market niche: Italian companies engaged in photovoltaic panel installation. However, the agency faces a significant challenge—it struggles to identify and reach potential clients that align with its target criteria.

MediaBuy's buyer persona is defined as small enterprises with a total revenue ranging between €500,000 and €5,000,000.

To address this challenge, the project proposes leveraging the digital platform “AIDA” (Analisi Informatizzata delle Aziende Italiane), which provides comprehensive data on Italian companies, including financial metrics and business details.

## Methodology
The AIDA platform facilitates an initial screening process, generating a list of companies based on the following criteria:

Industry Classification: The companies are filtered using the ATECO code 432101 (Installation of Electrical Systems), which broadly includes firms involved in photovoltaic panel installation.
Revenue Threshold: The total revenue from the most recent financial report must fall between €500,000 and €5,000,000.
As a result, the initial contact list comprises approximately 8,000 companies. However, the current list presents several challenges:

The general nature of the ATECO code includes many companies not directly involved in photovoltaic installations, leading to non-targeted results.
A significant number of companies lack a declared website.
None of the listed companies provide a public contact email.
Objectives
The project addresses the aforementioned challenges by implementing a three-step solution:

Website Identification:

Identify and retrieve missing websites for all companies in the contact list.
Generate an updated list of verified websites.
Website Crawling and Filtering:

Perform crawling of the identified websites.
Search for specific keywords such as "solar panels," "photovoltaic," and similar terms to confirm that the company operates within the target industry.
Retain only those companies whose websites contain the specified keywords.
Email Scraping:

Extract contact email addresses from the verified websites using web scraping techniques.
Expected Outcomes
By achieving the objectives outlined above, the project enables the creation of an optimized contact list tailored to the agency's needs. This refined list offers several benefits:

Increased Efficiency: Streamlines the lead generation process by ensuring only relevant companies are targeted.
Time and Resource Savings: Reduces the time and effort required to identify and qualify potential clients.
Improved Campaign Effectiveness: Provides verified websites and contact information, facilitating the execution of successful marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion
This project delivers a data-driven solution to the challenges faced by MediaBuy Srl, improving the overall efficiency of their client acquisition system. By automating website identification, keyword-based filtering, and email scraping, the tool ensures that the marketing agency can focus its resources on a highly qualified list of prospects, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of their lead generation campaigns.
